# Objectives

This workshop will go through the process of using R for academic research. We 
will cover the following topics: 

- Import raw data into R
- Organize a project directory
- Write code to transform raw data into clean data
- Use the clean data to write a reproducible report including models and visualizations share the code and report with colleagues (we'll talk about but not show how to use GitHub)
