# Clean Data

Store the output from your data cleaning scripts here. 
Use these files in your analysis scripts. 
You can save files in .RDS format and .csv format in this folder. We recommend .RDS
for working in R, but .csv can be useful for sharing data with collaboraters who may
be using other programs.
